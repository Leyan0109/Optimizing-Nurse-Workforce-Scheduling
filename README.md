# Optimizing-Nurse-Workforce-Scheduling
This project presents an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and Discrete Event Simulation model to optimize nurse workforce scheduling in a healthcare call centre. The model is implemented in Excel Solver and simulated in SIMUL8 to evaluate queue performance and nurse utilization.
